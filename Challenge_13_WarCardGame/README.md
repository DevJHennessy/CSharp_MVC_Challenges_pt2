<h1>War the Card Game!</h1>

<p>In this C# challenge I created a working card game of War using ASP.NET Web Forms. To begin the game, all fifty-two playing cards of a regular deck is dealt to two players. Each player then flips over the top card of their deck and the player with the highest card wins both cards. If the two cards are equal in rank, then a round of war begins, where each player places three cards face-down and then flips over a fourth card to battle. The highest card wins, or another round of war begins if the cards are equal in rank. Because the game can go on forever, the program stops after twenty-five rounds and the player with the most cards at that point wins the game.</p>
