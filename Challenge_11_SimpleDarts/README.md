<h1>A Simple Dart Game</h1>

<p>This program demonstrates the logic of a game of darts played by two players. A dart's board consists of twenty divided wedges, representing 1â€“20 points, with each wedge having a double and triple score section, plus the inner and outer bullseye, worth 50 and 25 points respectively. Each players has a five-percent chance to land in the double, triple, and inner bullseye sections. A player throws three darts during their turn, playing until one player reaches 300, or in the case of both players scoring over 300, whoever has the highest score wins.</p>
